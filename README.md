### **R**eally **H**igh-order **A**da**P**tive coupling for **S**imulation **O**rchestration in **PY**thon

This pure Python package demonstrates the application of a high-order code coupling strategy. It enables an accurate resolution of transient multiphysics problems requiring the coupling of existing specialised codes, e.g. fluid flow solver, heat diffusion solver...

The strategy is focused on problems of the form:
$$d_t y_i = f_i(t, y_i, u_i)$$
$$u_i = g_i(t, y_1, \cdots, y_N)$$
with $i \in [1,N]$, $N$ the number of subsystems, $y_i$ the state vector of the $i$-th subsystem, $u_i$ its input, e.g. prescribed boundary conditions, volumic source term...

The strategy relies on the introduction of approximations of the coupling variables in the form of polynomials of time. Each subsystem is integrated with its own code, potentially with an adaptive time substepping, taking into account the polynomially approximated evolution of its input $u_i$, which are updated after each coupling step.
It is possible to perform the coupling in explicit or implicit form. The latter improves both accuracy and stability, but requires the resolution of a fixed-point problem at each step.
Dynamic adaptation of the coupling time step is possible thanks to error estimates that can be directly derived from the polynomial approximations.

The present repository offers an example implementation of the previous strategy, with tutorials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

It has been developed at ONERA by Laurent Fran√ßois, based on a study initiated during his [PhD thesis](https://www.theses.fr/2022IPPAX004).

To test this package, run `python setup.py develop` to register it as a development package.
